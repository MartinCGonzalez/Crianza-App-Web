# Crianza-App-Web

<h2>Welcome!</h2>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
We set out to solve the problem posed by the "Dairy
Production" college career on the raising of the tambo lands, that the reality raised is that
today it is day there is no specific software that meets the needs of dairy farmers to have
control of their accounts through reports and analysis of events that can help plan for the
best use of their resources and also not to lose calf lives for not having reports of his health
status.
